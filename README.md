# powerbi

As of April 2022, I have lead a **Power BI User Group (PBUG)** for 2 years with over 100 members. 

To engage the community, I came up with the idea to create bite-sized challenges for employees/colleagues to upskill in Power BI in 30 minutes or less.

These aim to facilitate everyone's learning journeys whether it's through report creation or building applications for their work.

These challenges touch on a specific topic and members can participate in the challenge or work on it at a time that suits their schedule.

CHALLENGE 1 - Power Query and Hurricane Data

CHALLENGE 2 - Power Query and Marvel Data

CHALLENGE 3 - Power Query and Cars Data

CHALLENGE 4 - Drill-down Visuals and Squid Game Data

CHALLENGE 5 - DAX and Orange Lemonade Data
