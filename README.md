# powerbi

As of April 2022, I have lead a **Power BI User Group (PBUG)** for 2 years with over 100 members. 🤝

To engage the community, I came up with the idea to create bite-sized challenges for employees/colleagues to upskill in Power BI in 30 minutes or less. ⏱

These aim to facilitate everyone's learning journeys whether it's through report creation or building applications for their work. 📊

These challenges touch on a specific topic and members can participate in the challenge or work on it at a time that suits their schedule. 📅

CHALLENGE 1 - Power Query and Hurricane Data 🌪

CHALLENGE 2 - Power Query and Marvel Data ☄️

CHALLENGE 3 - Power Query and Cars Data 🚗

CHALLENGE 4 - Drill-down Visuals and Squid Game Data 🔮 

CHALLENGE 5 - DAX and Orange Lemonade Data 🍊🍋
